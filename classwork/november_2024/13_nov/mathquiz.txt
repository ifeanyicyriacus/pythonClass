generate a random mathematics question with integer between 1-1000

declare these variables: answer,question_generated, response, total

do this 10 times:
	random.rand(1,1001)
	generate first operand
	generate second operand
	go through an array of ["+","+","+","+","+", "*","*","*", "-","-"]
	create an array for question_generated
	create an array of answer

do these 10 times:
	ask questions[i]
	collect response[i]
	if answer[i] == response[i]:
		total += 1

display result:
	you got {total} of 10 question
	
if total <10:
	do this 10 times:
		if answer[i] != response[i]:
			display "questiion [i] of 10"
			display "You answered [responses[i]]"
			display "the correct answer is: answers[i]"
			"white space"
