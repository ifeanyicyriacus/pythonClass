a function to multiply two number passed into it without using the * operator

collect first number
store as number_1
collect second number
store as number_2
product

add number_1 to sum {number_2} times

2,3
2+2+2

return sum

accounting for float in second parameter of unknown length
power = 1
convert number_2 to string
	split them by delimiter "."
	a = whole number
	b = decimal number

33.453
a= 3
b = 453 >> len >> 3
concatinate {a} and {b} >> 33453
c = 33453
increase number_1 {int(c)} number of times
store as sum
divide sum by 10 {len(b)} number of times
store product

return product
